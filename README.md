Homework Repo for Challenge 11


## Author: Laura Bishop

## Overview

I received help and support from my fellow Data Vis classmates via our Discord Server as well as our class-provided Slack Channel. I regularly attend both before- and after-class Office Hours to engage the materials with the Instructor and TAs.

I re-reviewed the Module 11 Instructor Demos provided through GitLab extensively, often using it as a How To guide.

I did avail myself to the services of AskBCS Learning Assistant regarding importing BeautifulSoup. With the help of Robert, I was able to easily modify the starting code to fit my needs to finish the homework.
